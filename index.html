		<p> Computer Science Student in Vancouver <br/>
Hello, World! I’m Jonathan Chao a grade 12 student currently attending Templeton Secondary in Vancouver, British Columbia. Next year I plan on studying Computer Science at UBC or SFU.
My aspirations are to get a master's degree in computer science and work as a software engineer in the bay area. I am also very interested in machine learning and neural networks. I plan on working on self-driving cars as I think the technology is amazing and that it will have a positive effect on society.
Currently, my university friend and I are making an app to help the visually impaired navigate. You can find more about it at the bottom of my portfolio page. Asides from working on this project, I enjoy Forex & Commodity Trading, playing chess, messing around with python coding projects, or watching educational/entertaining YouTube videos such as Joma Tech, Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell, and Casually Explained.
At school, I am the founder and President of Chess Club. I plan on hosting a school-wide chess tournament. The Chess Club has about 15 active members who meet daily at lunch in the library. I am also an active member in clubs such as yearbook, library monitors in which I volunteer 3 shifts a week, Leo’s Club (Board Position), Free the Children, and a tutor at homework club.
Outside of school, I am an active senior cadet with 6 years of experience at 59 Vancouver squadron. I also enjoy casually playing sports and volunteer frequently at the community centres and schools. </p>
